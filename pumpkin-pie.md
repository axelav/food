## YIELD

8 servings

## INGREDIENTS

### CRUST

- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (150 grams)
- 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, preferably a high-fat European style, cold and - cut into cubes
- 2 to 4 tablespoons ice water, as needed

### FILLING

- 1 3/4 cups squash or pumpkin purée (see note)
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 3/4 cup dark brown sugar (153 grams)
- 2 tablespoons brandy
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger (4 grams)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon (3 grams)
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (3 grams)
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- Pinch ground clove

## PREPARATION

### CRUST

1. Make the crust: In a food processor, pulse together the flour and salt.
2. Add butter and pulse until the mixture forms chickpea-size pieces.
3. Add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse until the dough just comes together. It should be moist, but not wet.
4. On a lightly floured surface, gather the dough into a ball. Flatten into a disk with the heel of your hand.
5. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.

### FILLING

1. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to a 12-inch circle. Transfer crust to a 9-inch pie plate. Fold over any excess dough, then crimp edges. Prick crust all over with a fork. Chill crust for 30 minutes.
2. While the dough chills, heat oven to 375 degrees.
3. Line chilled crust with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans.
4. Bake for 20 minutes; remove foil and weights and bake until pale golden, 5 to 7 minutes more.
5. Cool on rack until needed.
6. Lower oven temperature to 325 degrees.
7. In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin purée, eggs, cream, dark brown sugar, brandy, ginger, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the nutmeg and clove.
8. Pour mixture into the cooled pie shell. Transfer pie to a large baking sheet.
9. Bake until crust is golden and center jiggles just slightly when shaken, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool completely before serving.

Note: To make butternut squash purée, peel, halve and seed a 2 1/2- to 3-pound squash and cut flesh into 1 1/2-inch chunks. Coat with melted butter or oil and roast at 400 degrees, stirring once or twice, until the squash is tender, about 30 to 45 minutes. Let cool, then purée in a food processor.
