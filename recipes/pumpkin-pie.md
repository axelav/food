5. cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.

### filling

2. while the dough chills, heat oven to 375 degrees.
3. line chilled crust with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans.
4. bake for 20 minutes; remove foil and weights and bake until pale golden, 5 to 7 minutes more.
5. cool on rack until needed.
6. lower oven temperature to 325 degrees.
7. in a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin purée, eggs, cream, dark brown sugar, brandy, ginger, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the nutmeg and clove.
8. pour mixture into the cooled pie shell. transfer pie to a large baking sheet.
